I learned how blockchain technolgy works, the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technology, the real life applications of blockchain and how to build a simple blockchain.

```js
 mineBlock(difficulty){
        while (this.hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== Array(difficulty - 1).join("0")){
           this.nonce++;
            this.hash = this.calculateHash();
          }
    }
```


### Continued development
